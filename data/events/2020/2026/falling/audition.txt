This heart-warming play centres around Robin and Jacqui, both confined to their homes owing to a phobia of satellites falling from the sky. They meet in a phobia chat room and become friends...can they become more if they can't leave?

Robin is living with his mum, while Jacqui has moved back with her dad. Robin speaks to a counsellor and we meet a friendly courier. Further character details in the next newsletter in the meantime if you would like a script to look over please get in touch.
