Keraunothnetophobia is the fear of being struck by man-made satellites falling back to earth.  Jacqui and Robin live just a few streets apart but are both prisoners of their fear of falling things.  Robin was struck on the head as a seven-year-old and has since then sought sanctuary at home, Jacqui’s fear began during the 7/7 bombings when she was trapped on the Tube.

Technology has its uses and for Robin and Jacqui it enables them to work from home. The internet is where they meet and strike up a friendship, but as their relationship develops both are forced to confront the fear that keeps them inside and explore what is real in their lives and what really matters; could they possibly meet?

James Graham is the author of acclaimed plays such as Dear England, Ink, Quiz and Best of Enemies. A History of Falling Things premiered in 2009 and is a 21st century love story that is fearful, funny and moving.
