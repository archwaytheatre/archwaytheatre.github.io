Chris Leask brings his clowning and physical comedy workshop back to the Archway for more brilliant insights.

13.30 to 15.30 for 13–17 year olds
16.00 to 18.00 for 18+.

“Making mistakes and ‘getting it wrong’ are hidden gems that can provide new insights for the performer and the character. I focus primarily on ensemble work, improvisation, clowning, and devising—skills invaluable not just for comedic performances, but for dramas, tragedies, and epics as well.

Confidence and commitment are crucial in acting, and I believe these are best developed by teaching participants to embrace the fear of failure. Because of this, I foster a supportive and playful environment where students can take risks, discover their unique voices, and feel confident in doing so. In the class I’ll firstly focus on group exercises where people can discover their natural clown. Once we have done that, we’ll do a variety of exercises that help the clowns find the comedic ‘game’ within scenes and hopefully show the participants how easy it can be to be entertaining while keeping it simple and being truthful.”
