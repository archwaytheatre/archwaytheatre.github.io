Anna Howie Presents:
Headlining: Jack Bowden

Jack Bowden is a Singer Songwriter from Southeast Kent. His songs often contain humorous elements mixed with heart wrenching story telling. Jacks passion for lyric writing is very obvious throughout all of his songs, his ability to play with words in a unique yet reachable way is at the forefront of his music. 
When performing live; he is equipped with a nylon string guitar that gives an almost Spanish feel to the set and an energy level that is unmatched. Cheeky yet heartfelt, you’ll be smiling throughout.

Supporting: Billy LeRiff

After six years fronting UK indie band Two Weeks In Nashville, Billy LeRiff steps into his own spotlight with a sound that’s raw, heartfelt, and full of character. Writing and recording everything from home, his solo work blends guitar-driven energy, textured synths, and hook-filled choruses; offering a more personal glimpse into the songwriter behind the stage presence.

As the voice of TWIN, Billy played sold-out shows across the UK and supported artists including Supergrass, Arlo Parks, and The Streets, earning millions of streams and views along the way.

His debut single ‘BEAUTIFUL’ marks a new chapter. One that captures the energy fans know him for, while revealing his most honest and authentic music yet.
