“Sometimes we get sad about things and we don’t like to tell other people that we are sad about them.  We like to keep it a secret.  Or, sometimes, we are sad, but we don’t really know why we are sad, so we say we aren’t sad, but we really are.”

Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old boy from Swindon, not only discovers his neighbour’s dog Wellington murdered with a garden fork, he also becomes the prime suspect.  Christopher decides to investigate the murder to clear his name, chronicling his discoveries in a book.

Christopher has an extraordinary brain and is exceptional at maths, but he is ill-equipped to interpret everyday life.  He has never ventured alone beyond the end of his road, he detests being touched and he distrusts strangers.  But Christopher’s detective work takes him on a frightening journey that turns his world upside-down, revealing secrets about his family as well as requiring him to confront all his fears at once.
