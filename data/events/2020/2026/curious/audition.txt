Fifteen-year-old Christopher is brilliant but ill-equipped to interpret everyday life. He has never ventured beyond the end of his street, but now he is determined to uncover who killed his neighbour’s dog.

His relentless detective work, forbidden by his father, takes him on a frightening journey that turns his world upside-down. Based on the best-selling novel, this life-affirming play has won multiple Tony and Olivier Awards including Best Play in London and New York.

The play is told from Christopher’s own unique perspective on the world and it’s this which makes the production so exciting, running through to all aspects of the production.

The entire cast must remain on stage throughout most of the play, with scenes running into one another without interruption, regardless of alterations in space, time or chronology. This means the entire cast will become a very cohesive team on stage for a physically demanding but creatively rewarding production.

This production will work on developing a performance ensemble, rather than segregating principal and secondary characters. There are 22 incidental characters that populate the story, and the scenes progress rapidly through many locations so there will be many rapid character changes needed on stage.

All auditionees must be comfortable with movement (no dance experience required) and require a positive approach to collaborative devising and working physically to create a world Christopher is imagining or realising for the first time.

The play is set in Swindon and London. Some characters may require a Swindon accent.

<b>The Ensemble</b>

Six multi-talented actors playing a diverse range of key roles throughout the play and heavily involved in movement.
