Rehearsals: starting Thursday, 14th May

All Maria and Callum want is the perfect Marvel meets Disney wedding...or do they? While the bride and groom each have their own serious doubts about getting married, the wedding guests have too much to drink, place bets, bicker and nearly die of starvation.

Grandma Pat is getting fed up with waiting. The groom's brother unwittingly becomes the victim of a strange game of cat and mouse. Uncle Chris accidentally spills wine on his sister's girlfriend. The groom’s divorced parents can't stand to be near each other, and the maid of honour is trying not to lose her mind, or get distracted by the best man.

I Do Not is a snappy yet curiously thoughtful comedy, taking a modern look at what it means to be in love, and if marriage is really worth more than the paper it’s written on. Ridiculous in places, and touching in others, I Do Not offers an updated view on what commitment really means.

This is a big-cast comedy with a big heart. There are fourteen larger-than-life characters up for grabs, with ages ranging from 16 to 90. If you’re an actor looking for a production that’s a little silly but very fun, then I Do Not is the perfect play for you. Each character gets their moment to shine, as well as be amongst the chaos of the wider group, bouncing off each other in some delightful mayhem.
