Rehearsals will start Thursday, 14th May

All Maria and Callum want is the perfect Marvel meets Disney wedding…or do they? While the bride and groom each have their own serious doubts about getting married, a rabble of friends and family gather for the big day. The wedding guests have too much to drink, place bets, bicker and nearly die of starvation.

Grandma Pat is getting fed up with waiting. The groom's brother unwittingly becomes the victim of a strange game of cat and mouse. Uncle Chris accidentally spills wine on his sister's girlfriend. The groom’s divorced parents can't stand to be near each other, and the maid of honour is trying not to lose her mind.

I Do Not is a snappy yet curiously thoughtful comedy, taking a modern look at what it means to be in love, and if marriage is really worth more than the paper it’s written on. Ridiculous in places, and touching in others, I Do Not offers an updated view on what commitment really means.

If you’re an actor looking for a production that’s a little silly, very fun and full of heart, then I Do Not is the perfect play for you. Each character gets their moment to shine, as well as be amongst the chaos of the wider group, bouncing off each other in some delightful mayhem.
