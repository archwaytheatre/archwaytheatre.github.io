All Maria and Callum want is the perfect Marvel meets Disney wedding…or do they? While the bride and groom each have their own serious doubts about getting married, a rabble of friends and family gather for the big day. The wedding guests have too much to drink, place bets, bicker and nearly die of starvation.

Grandma Pat is getting fed up with waiting. The groom's brother unwittingly becomes the victim of a strange game of cat and mouse. Uncle Chris accidentally spills wine on his sister's girlfriend. Janine and Cillian are divorced and can't stand to be near each other, and maid of honour Anneli is trying not to lose her mind, or get distracted by the best man.

And they said your wedding should be one of the best days of your life.

'I Do Not' is a snappy yet curiously thoughtful comedy, taking a modern look at what it means to be in love, and if marriage is really worth more than the paper it’s written on. Ridiculous in places, and touching in others, 'I Do Not' offers an updated view on what commitment really means.
