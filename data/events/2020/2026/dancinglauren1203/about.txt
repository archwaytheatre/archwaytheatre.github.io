Come on down to The Archway Studio for an exciting evening of Line Dancing, led by long-time Country music fan, Lauren Fielding. Designed for beginners and enthusiasts alike, this fun and relaxed session will focus on building the Line Dance basics, giving folks the chance to learn a few routines together in a low-pressure environment.

For more experienced dancers, there will be the option to learn an extra Improver level routine in the latter part of the session. If you prefer to keep things simple, no problem - the bar will be open for y’all, if you’d like to grab yourselves a tipple to toast your progress!

No experience needed – just bring your enthusiasm!

Top Tips for a Rootin’ Tootin’ Good Time:
 - Stay hydrated: Bring a water bottle!
 - Wear your favourite Western attire or gym gear
 - Cowboy boots are encouraged but bring back-up footwear if you’re not used to dancing in them!
