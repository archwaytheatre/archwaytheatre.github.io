This beloved classic follows the developing relationship between Rita, a spirited working-class hairdresser from Liverpool, and Frank, a jaded middle-aged university lecturer.

While Rita is keen to better herself through education,  Frank simply wants to earn extra money through tutoring to support his drinking habit. The pair form an unlikely bond over the course of a year - challenging their own perceptions of society, and of each other.

This play explores not only their own feelings, but also themes of class, educational potential, identity, and just what constitutes personal fulfilment. Touching, witty, warm and humorous, it promises to be a great night of theatre.
