Debra is delighted to present this two-handed stage comedy written by Willy Russell.

Rehearsals commence early December, under the watchful eye of our lovely stage manager Olly Taylor-Welch.

The story revolves around two characters, Rita, a spirited Liverpudlian working-class hairdresser who seeks to better herself through education and her unconventional relationship with her mature alcoholic tutor.

Like the film which many of you may know, this play explores themes of class disparity, intellectual potential, identity, personal fulfilment and developing romantic feelings.

This production offers two exceptional parts for experienced actors.

Playing age ranges: Rita approximately 30-40 and Frank roughly 40-50 but I have no preconceived ideas, and these age ranges are not rigid, so, if you are interested but outside these ranges, please do come along regardless!

Rita is very lively, brash and full of life giving more energy to the more reserved Frank, and the whole play is an exploration of their growing friendship and affection for each other.

If you want to talk more, or to peruse a script (limited copies) then please get in touch. I would be delighted to chat to you more about what I hope to be a fun, funny and moving production.
