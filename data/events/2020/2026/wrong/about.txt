When their teacher mysteriously disappears and strange things begin to happen, the pupils at Ennville decide to investigate and find themselves in a different dimension, a parallel world.

The Wrong Way Round is a hilarious musical mystery adventure with memorable, spine-tingling songs. Who is the Sticky Shadow? Why does Miss Sharman have a Slimeometer and why is the sign of the Zinnistar Research Facility the wrong way round?

With so many memorable characters and opportunities for our workshoppers to shine, <em>The Wrong Way Round</em> is not to be missed!
