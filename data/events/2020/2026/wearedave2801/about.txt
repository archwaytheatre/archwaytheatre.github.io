What is We Are Dave?

We Are Dave is an improv comedy group comprising Dave Heron, Emily Joy, Lewis Hill, and Mikey Lewis - all improvisers with years of combined experience. They've performed multiple times at Dingbats, Hoopla (London), and Scoops (Brighton) and recently had our first "long-show" at the Lambeth Fringe Festival.

Dave Heron is the director of We Are Dave and is an improviser with at least 7 years' experience of performing, having been trained by Dingbats, Hoopla, TJ & Dave and Liz Allen (of Improv Olympic - iO). He was a regular cast member of the Hoopla house-team, Gamez (performing at the Camden, Brighton and Dublin Fringe Festivals), has performed with SlapBot at the Maidstone Festival in 2024 and is now taking We Are Dave to the Brighton Festival in May.

A one-act play set in a single location, We Are Dave is a sumptuous, full-fat feast of broken dreams, fleeting moments and fragmented lives; a wholly improvised show, oozing out of an alternative, underbelly universe. Behold, the citizens of We Are Dave!
