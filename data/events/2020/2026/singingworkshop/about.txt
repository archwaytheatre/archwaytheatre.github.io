Oooo we've got an extra special treat for you and there are limited spaces so book early to avoid disappointment!

Join acclaimed musician Bruce Ncube as he teaches uplifting, traditional songs from his native country of Zimbabwe, carrying messages of struggle, determination, courage, inspiration & togetherness, in 3-to-6-part harmonies. There is no need to be an experienced singer or a member to take part in this workshop, all are welcome, and we would love to see some new faces.

Bruce is a Zimbabwean born and raised British award winning artist and African Cultural Ambassador with over 18 years of touring and traveling across the United Kingdom teaching and performing in some of the world's biggest platforms such as WOMAD, Glastonbury Festival and Edinburgh International Festival to name just a few.

His method of teaching is in the traditional oral/aural way; reminiscent of long ago when people would gather around a fire in the evenings, at weddings, funerals and whilst tilling the land and start weaving harmonies. His approach is inclusive and participatory, designed to build people's confidence in singing.

This workshop is recommended for ages 16+. Please bring a water bottle and lunch for the day; tea and coffee will be available, and the bar will be open.
