Alice in Wonderland is a truly delightful panto, set in Lewis Carroll’s fantastical Wonderland and features many of the well-loved characters.
Wonderland is in danger from the nasty Knave of Spades and can only be saved by a magical golden heart, supplied by the Wizard of Muddleup Wood.
Cue Alice, who along with her mother and Wally the Joker come to the rescue.

Featuring a slightly surreal and incredibly funny Mad Hatter's tea party, plus hilarious madcap antics courtesy of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, not to mention the Queen of Hearts, who is a cut above.
This panto has everything you would expect from the strange and fantastical world that is Alice in Wonderland!

Bring your panto smile, jazz hands, energy and imagination! We can’t wait to see you down the rabbit hole! We’re all mad here.....
If you have any further questions then please don’t hesitate to contact Amy Blane, or Gwyneth Boorer for more information.
