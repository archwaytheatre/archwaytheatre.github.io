Alice in Wonderland is a truly delightful panto, set in Lewis Carrollâ€™s fantastical Wonderland and features many of the well-loved characters.

Wonderland is in danger from the nasty Knave of Spades and can only be saved by a magical golden heart, supplied by the Wizard of Muddleup Wood.

Cue Alice, who along with her mother and Wally the Joker come to the rescue.

Featuring a slightly surreal and incredibly funny Mad Hatter's tea party, plus hilarious madcap antics courtesy of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, not to mention the Queen of Hearts, who is a cut above.

This panto has everything you would expect from the strange and fantastical world that is Alice in Wonderland!
