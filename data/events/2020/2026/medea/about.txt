Medea is a barbarian sorceress who fell in love with the Greek hero Jason and aided him in his quest for the famed Golden Fleece. Without her intervention, he would likely have failed and died. Now returned to Greece with their two sons, Jason seeks to take a new bride in the daughter of Creon, the Corinthian king, and tries to cast Medea aside.

Rejected and betrayed, the play concerns Medea’s bloody and terrible vengeance on her unfaithful husband and all those around him. It is a story of passionate love turned to hate, of justice and injustice confused with pride and rage, and the shocking and murderous consequences thereof.
