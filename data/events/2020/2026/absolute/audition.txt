Summer 1940. After an aerial dog fight, Pilot Officer Jack Absolute flies home to rejoin his intrepid young Hurricane squadron.

Back on British soil, Jack is shocked to find his old flame, Lydia, on the base. Setting his sights on winning her heart, but with turbulence and hilarity never far away, Jack’s advances quickly turn to anarchy when the young heiress demands to be loved on her own terms.

The action is largely based at the house and grounds of Mrs Malaprop – she of lexicographical dexterity and faultless electrocution.

Sheridan’s classic comedy of manners, The Rivals, is given an uproarious Battle of Britain update by Richard Bean, the award-winning writer of One Man, Two Guvnors, and Oliver Chris.

This will be a pukka, bang-on experience for all involved, on or off stage. No deployment is small as we defend the honour of The Archway Theatre!

Simply think The 39 Steps, mixed with One Man Two Guvnors and a dash of The Dam Busters. There will be comedy, high jinks, dancing and drama. 
If you can Lindy Hop or fancy learning, that might be something we explore. 😊

This really is a great, fun show to get involved in so get in touch to chat about any of it .😊
