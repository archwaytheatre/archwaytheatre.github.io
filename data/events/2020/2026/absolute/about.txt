Summer 1940. After an aerial dog fight, Pilot Officer Jack Absolute flies home to rejoin his squadron and is shocked to find old flame, Lydia, on the base. Setting his sights on winning her heart (though with turbulence and hilarity never far away) Jack’s advances quickly turn to anarchy when the young heiress demands to be loved on her own terms.

The pursuit of love is also on the minds of other squadron members, their general and the formidable owner of their country house base, the infamous Mrs Malaprop.

Sheridan’s classic comedy of manners, The Rivals, is given an uproarious update by Oliver Chris and Richard Bean, the award-winning writer of One Man, Two Guvnors.

Hilarious mix-ups, crazy word play, heartwarming and heart-wrenching fun - all peppered with swinging songs of the 1940s - this is one you really don’t want to miss!
