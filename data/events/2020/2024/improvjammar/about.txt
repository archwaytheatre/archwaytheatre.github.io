Join us at the Archway Theatre for an entertaining evening where art meets improv!

Your ideas are the paint, the stage is the canvas, the performers are the brushes, the bits between the scenes are the pot of water in which you wash your brush... I could continue with this analogy, but it's much easier to be literal sometimes:

A variety of improv comedy groups will use drawings and sculptures that you create on the night to inspire improvised games, scenes, stories and maybe even songs!

Turn up at 19:40 when doors open to craft your art! Whether you've won the Turner prize or you've never picked up a pencil, our performers will treat your creations like masterpieces! Perfect for those who prefer their suggestions to be seen, not heard.

This show will also feature some 'jam', where participants of the Dingbats Improv workshops can sign up to play some fun arty improv games in the show.

So don't just picture it, come along to this unique event and turn your sketches into... sketches.

The (cashless) bar in the function room will be open. Suitable for ages 16+Tickets: Â£10. Online ticket sales only. Ticket sales close 1 hour before the start.

8pm (doors 7.40pm)
