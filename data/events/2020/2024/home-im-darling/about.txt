This witty and thought-provoking play follows one woman on her quest to become the perfect 1950s housewife.

Judy & Johnny appear to be living the dream, but beneath the gorgeous frocks, vibrant décor and abundance of cocktails, life for the couple isn’t as picturesque as it first seems. Every marriage needs a little fantasy to keep it sparkling, but an unusual life decision raises concerns from their loved ones, and cracks start to form when Johnny invites his new boss over for drinks.

This retro rebrand will leave you deliberating over your Martinis.
