Set in the 80s, Di and Viv and Rose is a play about life and friendship and all that implies. Three girls meet on their first day at University. They move into a flat together and we follow their lives through three years at University and beyond.
I think the three girls chosen, will have a wonderful time rehearsing and acting in this heart-warming play. I envy you!
