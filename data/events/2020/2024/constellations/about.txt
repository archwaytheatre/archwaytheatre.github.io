A chance encounter at a barbeque between a beekeeper and a quantum physicist, is there a spark?  They get along, they strike up a relationship or perhaps they donâ€™t.

They go their separate ways, or do they go home together. Any and every future outcome is possible in the multiverse.

This is a play about love and the complexities of navigating relationships.   This play explores the infinite trajectories that love can take to bring people together or pull them apart, through fate, chance and choice. Contains adult themes, mature language, discusses terminal illness and assisted suicide.

Elle Foray and Laura Day take on the parts of Rosie the beekeeper and Marianne the quantum physicist are performing Constellations on Tuesday 30th April, Thursday 2nd May, Saturday 4th May at 7.45pm, Wednesday 8th May and Friday 10th May.

Matt Donald and Gwyneth Boorer take the parts of Roland the beekeeper and Marianne the quantum physicist and will be performing Constellations on Wed 1st May, Friday 3rd May and Saturday 4th May at 2pm, Thursday 9th May and Saturday 11th May.

Our Young Adults workshop for 16-21 year olds is welcoming new members and is led by Ella Sowton with Leigh Evans. In the lead up to the Constellations audition several of the Young Adults spent time looking at various extracts of the play and they did a fantastic job, their youth brings another different take on the play and so the Archway Theatre is excited that two pairs of actors from the Young Adults will also have the opportunity to perform Constellations and we hope that our theatre community will also come together to support their one off performances. Liv Brown and Rachel Harrison will be performing on Monday 6th May and Jenna Simmonds-Wood and Lorna Flanagan will be performing on Tuesday 7th May.

Content warning:
Whilst Constellations is a comedy it does contain some strong language, some references to assisted dying and terminal illness.
