The Archway Theatre sets the stage for Dingbats Improv, delivering an evening of unscripted theatrical delights. Witness games, scenes, and stories crafted in the moment - it's entertainment at its most unpredictable! The night will be a fun mix of performances from a variety of improv acts and improv jam games. In an improv jam anyone who attends our workshops can jump on stage with other improvisers and have fun making up scenes and stories together. Even if you prefer just to be an audience member, you're guaranteed a delightful night of entertainment. "Pure genius and pure stupidity! Loved every moment of it!" *****"
