Archway’s newest directors AND writers, Jenna & Abi, are bringing us something a
little bit different (but very exciting) to the studio this year! An opportunity to get
involved in some meaningful and powerful theatre, tackling hard subjects and raising
awareness for important issues facing many young people today. We would love to
also welcome new faces and encourage all to audition. If cast, you will be asked to
become a member.

Alive or Living? is a short production composed of two 1-act plays – ‘Schrödinger’s
Boys’ written & directed by Abigail Field, and ‘It Takes Time’ written & directed by
Jenna Simmonds-Wood.

Each piece provides a window into the effects of depression and suicide on both the
person directly affected and the people surrounding them and will therefore contain
themes of such.
