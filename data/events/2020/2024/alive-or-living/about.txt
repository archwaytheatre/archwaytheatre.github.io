A production composed of two 1-act plays – ‘Schrödinger’s Boys’ written & directed by Abigail Field, and ‘It Takes Time’ written & directed by Jenna Simmonds-Wood.

Each piece provides a window into the effects of depression and suicide on both the person directly affected and the people surrounding them and will therefore contain themes of such.
