Terra Nova is a fascinating and beautiful play by the Academy Award-winning screenwriter for 'Silence of the Lambs', Ted Tally, that recounts the ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition, led by Capt. Robert Falcon Scott, drawn from the journals and letters found with the bodies of the final three members of the Expedition.

As each dies one by one, the play captures with chilling intensity the courage and bravery of the men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.

The action of the play blends scenes of the explorer and his men at various stages of their ordeal in a mixture of fantasy and realism via flashbacks of Scott with his wife and with fateful glimpses of his Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen.
