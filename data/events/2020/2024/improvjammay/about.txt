Join us in the Archway Theatre Studio for another brilliant Dingbats Improv Show!

This night of laughs will begin with a showcase from the latest graduates of the Dingbats Musical Improv Course. Save yourself the rail fare to the West End and watch as they create theatrical songs out of thin air, backed by the talented Jon Mizler on piano, weaving melodies and lyrics in the moment to craft unforgettable musical numbers.

Following the showcase, the stage opens up for an improv jam session. Here, any improviser can step up, join forces with others, and invent scenes and stories on the spot. Whether you're performing or just enjoying the show from the audience, you're in for an evening of creative, unscripted joy!
