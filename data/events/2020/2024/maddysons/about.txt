The Maddysons, East Surreyâ€™s premier (and maybe only) acoustatronic 5-piece musical combo, are bringing a fabulous Friday night of live music to the Archway Studio. Does the name sound familiar? Well the band is named after their singer and Archway's very own Mrs Darling, Fairy Queen and Musical Director extraordinaire, Maddy Jowett! They have been playing together and entertaining audiences for over 7 years and we are excited to bring their floor-filling tunes and soulful sounds to you, on May 17th.
