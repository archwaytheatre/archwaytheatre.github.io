Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes at a theatre……  come and find out at our open day!

We are giving you a full pass to come and see how we produce a show from make up, lighting, backstage to costumes. You will be shown around our marvellous theatre complex, accessing all areas and enjoy some tasters of our costumes, the wonderful Youth Workshop, some hilarious improvisation and devised sketches, taking in our main theatre and studio facilities. It’s not to be missed!

Our bar will be open, and we also offer light refreshments.

We look forward to welcoming you.
