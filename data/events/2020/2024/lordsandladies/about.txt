The Witches are back! Following on from our sell-out production of Terry Pratchett’s ‘Wyrd Sisters’ last year, we are delighted to present the further adventures of Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. Seeing as how that play was inspired by ‘the Scottish Play’ (which we also did last year), it seemed to make sense that as we performed ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ this year we should couple it with Pratchett’s sideways take on that play too.

Mysterious crop circles are appearing all over the Kingdom of Lancre – this can mean only one thing: the “Lords and Ladies” (you should never say El**s out loud…) are back – and they are distinctly NOT fluttery and twinkly. It’s up to the Wyrd Sisters to sort it out.
Throw in a moody, teenage ‘wannabe’ witch, some rude mechanicals and a couple of wizards (not to mention a VERY distinctive Librarian) and you have a recipe for much hilarity, mingled with Pratchett’s very own, profound philosophical observations.

The show is being presented in the Studio for 6 performances only, so tickets will be at a premium – book soon to avoid disappointment. If you saw ‘Wyrd Sisters’ you will love this – but if you missed it, that’s OK – this story, although technically a sequel, is a ‘stand-alone’ tale.
