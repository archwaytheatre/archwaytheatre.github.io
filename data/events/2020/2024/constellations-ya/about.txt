A chance encounter at a barbeque between a beekeeper and a quantum physicist, is there a spark?  They get along, they strike up a relationship or perhaps they donâ€™t.

They go their separate ways, or do they go home together. Any and every future outcome is possible in the multiverse.

This is a play about love and the complexities of navigating relationships.   This play explores the infinite trajectories that love can take to bring people together or pull them apart, through fate, chance and choice. Contains adult themes, mature language, discusses terminal illness and assisted suicide.
