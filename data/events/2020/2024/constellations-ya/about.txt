A chance encounter at a barbeque between a beekeeper and a quantum physicist, is there a spark?  They get along, they strike up a relationship or perhaps they don’t.

They go their separate ways, or do they go home together. Any and every future outcome is possible in the multiverse.

This is a play about love and the complexities of navigating relationships.   This play explores the infinite trajectories that love can take to bring people together or pull them apart, through fate, chance and choice. Contains adult themes, mature language, discusses terminal illness and assisted suicide.

Our Young Adults workshop for 16-21 year olds is welcoming new members and is led by Ella Sowton with Leigh Evans. In the lead up to the Constellations audition several of the Young Adults spent time looking at various extracts of the play and they did a fantastic jon, their youth brings another different take on the play and so the Archway Theatre is excited that two pairs of actors from the Young Adults will also have the opportunity to perform Constellations and we hope that our theatre community will also come together to support their one off performances. Liv Brown and Rachel Harrison will be performing on Monday 6th May and Jenna Simmonds-Wood and Lorna Flanagan will be performing on Tuesday 7th May. Tickets for their performances will be priced at £9

Content warning:
Whilst Constellations is a comedy it does contain some strong language, some references to assisted dying and terminal illness.
