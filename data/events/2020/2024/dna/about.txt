When a group of teenagers bullying another student go too far, they have to decide how to handle the situation: Do they cover up what they have done, or do they come clean? Can they stick together and handle the pressure, or will they crumble?

DNA is a dark comedy written for young performers by Dennis Kelly (perhaps best known for writing the book for the musical Matilda). The play was added to the GCSE syllabus in 2010 and is frequently studied in schools. DNA questions whether cruelty is learnt or inherent within us all.

Filled with dark humour this production showcases the talents of the Archway's young adult performers and is not to be missed.

Warning: this production includes swearing, themes and instances of violence, bullying and victimisation.
