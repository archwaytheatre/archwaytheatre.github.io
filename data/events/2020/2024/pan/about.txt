Come and join us for a magical adventure in Neverland.

There will be pirates and fairies, flower people and lost boys alongside fabulous Dame Sissy Smee.

Captain Hook is determined to defeat the boy who won’t grow up, but Wendy, Tinkerbell and cheeky crocodile have other ideas. Our cast is full of familiar faces, new faces, young faces, and those who don’t want to grow up.
