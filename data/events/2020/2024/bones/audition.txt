Bones is a dark comedy, set in a 1960s porn Cinema, where the receptionist ‘accidentally’ kidnaps Reggie Kray. You can’t get much more bizarre than that!

Two Jewish brothers are at war with each other. Their business is on the verge of bankruptcy, and they owe a shed-load of money to a local gangster. But all of their troubles seem to be over when one of them kidnaps Reggie Kray!

Sharp, uncompromising and witty, Bones is a deliciously dark comedy about family ties, gangland warfare and a man in a dress!

The language is very strong, with violence associated with gangland Britain in the 1960s. I saw this performed in Sunderland and have wanted to direct it ever since.
