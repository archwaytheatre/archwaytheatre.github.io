In the Yorkshire mining town of Grimley, bandleader Danny's dreams of leading the colliery brass band to victory in the national championships at the Albert Hall seem 'out of tune' with reality, as workers at the local mine choose between picket lines and redundancy packages. But when Flugelhorn playing Gloria returns to her hometown, heads are turned, spirits are raised, and the band get their 'oompah' back. But what's the real reason for Gloria coming back? And can a community that's fighting to maintain dignity and hope, survive another set of betrayals?
