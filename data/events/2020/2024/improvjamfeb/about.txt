The Archway Theatre and Dingbats Improv presents an evening of fun improvised games, scenes, and stories all made up on the spot.

The first half will feature performances from a variety of improv acts and the second half will be an improv jam.

In an improv jam anyone who attends our workshops can jump on stage with other improvisers and have fun making up scenes and stories together. Of course, you can have a fun evening out and enjoy watching without performing.

The bar in the function room will be open.

Suitable for ages 16+
