Is there such a thing as too many muffins?

Who needs to go to the National Theatre, when Oscar Wildeâ€™s witty comedy of manners is brought to sparkling life on our own lovely stage, bringing a smile to the cold, dark days of early 2025? Who exactly is Earnest? Is there such a thing as too many muffins? What on earth is Bunbury-ing and what, oh what is the significance of the handbag?

Full of fabulous characters, witty dialogue, hilarious farce and a smouldering, restrained sexiness, this will be a production not to be missed.
