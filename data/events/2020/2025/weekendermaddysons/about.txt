The Maddysons, East Surrey’s premier (and maybe only) acoustatronic 5-piece musical combo, are bringing a fabulous Friday night of live music to the Archway Studio. Does the name sound familiar? Well, the band is named after their singer and Archway's very own Mrs Darling, Fairy Queen and Musical Director extraordinaire, Maddy Jowett! They have been playing together and entertaining audiences for over 8 years and we are excited to bring their floor-filling tunes and soulful sounds to you, on June 27th.

They are the first performer in our Studio Gig Weekender. Saturday night sees Whitesize bring their crowd friendly indie, rock and dash of classic punk to the Studio.  ​You can get tickets for both nights for £17.50. Twice the entertainment. Tripple the fun, and a get way to both support your local theatre and live music.
