A black comedy set in modern times which explores family and feminism through the lives of a grandmother, a mother and a daughter. From their relationships, conversations and experiences emerge stories of love, loss, pain deceit and indigestion.

Lucy Miles has only just embarked on playwriting having spent most of her professional life working as an NHS doctor in general practice and women's health. Heartburn is her first play and was inspired by the stories and experiences of the many strong and resilient women she has met over the years.

We are delighted to be presenting the premi√®re of this new play in the Studio from 11th to 13th September. A funny and moving contemporary drama about love, life, family and friendship.
