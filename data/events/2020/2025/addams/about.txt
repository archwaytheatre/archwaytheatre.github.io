A wonderfully crazy, new musical comedy.

The Addams Family is a wonderfully crazy, new musical comedy created by Jersey Boys authors Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, and Drama Desk Award winner Andrew Lippa (The Wild Party) and based on the original Addams Family characters created by Charles Addams. The Addams Family features an original story, and it’s every father’s nightmare. Wednesday Addams, that well known macabre teenager, has grown up and fallen in love.

The only problem is that the target of her affection is respectable and not like the Addams clan at all and what’s more, they have never met him. When she shares her secret with him, Gomez Addams must do something he’s never done before — keep a secret from his beloved wife, Morticia.

How will Pugsley cope when his sister doesn’t want to torture him anymore? How will the ‘meet the parents’ dinner go? And what will the Addams family ancestors make off all the shenanigans and secrets?

The only way to find out is to book a ticket and join this spooky family for a truly Addams family adventure.
