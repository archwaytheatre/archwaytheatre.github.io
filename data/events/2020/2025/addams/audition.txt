Based on comic characters created by Charles Addams in a series of magazine cartoons
and popularised by the 1960s tv series and 1990s movies. In the kooky, upside-down world
of the Addams Family the quirky family still must deal with many of the same challenges
faced by any other family. While the Addams have lived by their unique values for hundreds
of years their macabre, beloved daughter Wednesday is now an eighteen-year-old young woman
and has fallen in love with Lucas Beineke, a boy from a ‘normal’ Ohio family.

The Beinekes are the most un-Addams sounding family you think you might meet!
To make matters worse, Wednesday has invited the Beinekes to the Addams’ home for
one ‘normal’ dinner. During the events that unfold secrets are disclosed, relationships are
tested, and the Addams family must face up to the one horrible thing they’ve managed to
avoid for generations: change.

Can’t wait to see you all – Ali Hannant and Maddie Jowett
