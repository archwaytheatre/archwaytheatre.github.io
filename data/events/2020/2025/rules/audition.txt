Everyone creates coping strategies or rules for living. But what happens when an extended family gathers for Christmas and each member follows those rules, rigidly? In this theatrically playful, dark comedy, the instructions are there for everyone to see – so there’s really no place to hide.

Trigger warnings: Strong language and adult themes. References to mental and physical illness.
