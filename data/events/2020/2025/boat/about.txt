“There are a few seriously funny books that remain great for all time. Three Men in a Boat is one of these” The Guardian

“Timeless appeal” The Independent

“Pitch-perfect comedy about, well, three men in a boat” The Telegraph

Giles Shenton "creates an instant rapport with the audience, drawing us into his world and making the characters in it so real we feel you have known them forever. " Edinburgh Fringe Review

"Skilfully distilled from Jerome K. Jerome’s comic masterpiece into 95 minutes of pure delight. To those who wondered if the same team could live up to the earlier success of Old Herbaceous, the answer was an emphatic yes. A master class in confidence, stagecraft and delivery." Opening Night Review

“The nearest thing to "audio slapstick" I've ever heard, culminating in the sublime comedy of opening a tin, when you've forgotten the tin opener. It is not often that you come out of a theatrical performance feeling like you've been sharing happy and hilarious times, safe from a cruel world & wrapped in a warm blanket.” Vera Fletcher Review
