Do not miss out on a wonderful collaboration between your Comedy Cottage and the wonderful Archway Theatre.
Set in Victorian railway arches, The Archway Theatre has a beautiful, tiered auditorium and lovely cosy bar, where you can pre book your interval drinks, have them waiting for you, and relax in gorgeous boutique surroundings. Situated just by Horley Station, an easy rail journey or short drive from Reigate, Redhill and Crawley .
