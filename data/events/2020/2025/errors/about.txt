Following on from the success of last year’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, we are delighted to once again be teaming up with the beautiful gardens at Wakehurst, serving up some open air Shakespeare in the (fingers crossed) summer sunshine.

This year, it’s his chaotic A Comedy of Errors that will be getting the special treatment. Full of mistaken identity, slapstick and witty wordplay, this riotous farce will definitely not be one to miss.

Bring a picnic and relax in nature, while we all run around like maniacs!
