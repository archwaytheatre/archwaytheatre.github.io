Following on from the success of last year’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, we are delighted to once again be serving up some open air Shakespeare in the (fingers crossed) summer sunshine.

This year we’re teaming up with the walled garden at Tilgate Park to bring you his chaotic “A Comedy of Errors”. Full of mistaken identity, slapstick and witty wordplay, this riotous farce will definitely not be one to miss. Bring a picnic and relax in nature, while we all run around like maniacs!
