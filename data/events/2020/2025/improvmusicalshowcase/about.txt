Westside meets Westend in our Musical Improv Showcase!

Get ready to raise the roof by defying gravity as we bring you a double dose of musical improv! The graduates from two recent Dingbats Improv courses, one diving into the art of improvised musicals, the other into the world of freestyle hip hop, are coming together for one unforgettable night at The Archway Studio!

This double course showcase will present a range of improvised musical scenes and games with everything from epic rap battles that'll have you hollering for more to ensemble numbers that you'll be singing on the way home.

Backed by the legendary Jon Mizler on keys, and hosted by the course teachers Lewis Hill and George Butcher, don't miss this unique night of dropping beats and hitting notes. Itâ€™s gonna be the greatest show!
