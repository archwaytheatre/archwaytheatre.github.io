Funny, devastatingly honest, dangerous and utterly compelling.

A Dollâ€™s House, written by the great Norwegian playwright and theatre director Henrik Ibsen, caused scandal and controversy when first staged in 1879, but also attracted great critical acclaim and, interestingly, full houses.

The play has continued to attract actors, directors and audiences all over the world - and no wonder. All the characters are flesh and blood, as real and relevant today as when the play was first performed. It is in turn tender, funny, devastatingly honest, dangerous and utterly compelling.

It takes us on the journey of Nora Helmer, from what appears to be her perfect life with marriage to an adoring husband and their three beautiful children, to her decision to break free of convention and embark on a new life of her own. Not one to be missed.
