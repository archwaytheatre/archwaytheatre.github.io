Steven Moffat, the award-winning writer of Dr Who and Sherlock Holmes gives us a smash hit play The Unfriend – “the funniest new play by a British author since Ayckbourn at his peak,” said the critics.

When Peter and Debbie meet Elsa, a lusty, non woke, Trump loving widow from the USA on holiday they agree to stay in touch – but you never do – do you?

So, when Elsa invites herself to stay they decide to look her up online, but it’s too late as they learn about Elsa and deadly danger is on its way! But how do you protect those you love – after all it’s a bit impolite to ask questions! A hilarious and satirical look at middle-class England’s instinct to appear nice.
