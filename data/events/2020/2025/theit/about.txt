We are delighted that our young adults will be taking to the main stage this year to bring you an exciting production of this play, which grapples with issues arising from adolescent mental health, and ‘the rage within’.

Told from the perspective of a teenager, with support from a flexible cast comprising various characters, the play considers how people cope when their inner feelings take unexpected forms.

Written specifically with young casts in mind, this play was first performed in 2021,and went on to win ‘best play for young audiences’ at the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain Awards 2023.

This should be a very exciting piece of theatre, and tickets are likely to sell fast.
