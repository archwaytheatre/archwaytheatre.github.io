“My teaching methods emphasise truthfulness, openness, and explorational exercises, creating a safe space for participants to make mistakes and learn from them. Through my 12 years of acting on stage and screen, I have discovered that mistakes and ‘getting it wrong’ are hidden gems that can provide new insights for the performer and the character. I focus primarily on ensemble work, improvisation, clowning, and devising—skills invaluable not just for comedic performances, but for dramas, tragedies, and epics as well.

Confidence and commitment are crucial in acting, and I believe these are best developed by teaching participants to embrace the fear of failure. Because of this, I foster a supportive and playful environment where students can take risks, discover their unique voices, and feel confident in doing so. In the class I’ll firstly focus on group exercises where people can discover their natural clown. Once we have done that we’ll do a variety of exercises that help the clowns find the comedic ‘game’ within scenes and hopefully show the participants how easy it can be to be entertaining while keeping it simple and being truthful.”
