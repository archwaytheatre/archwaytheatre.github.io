A bawdy, fun, big-hearted love letter to the theatre.

England. The swinging 1660's. King Charles II has revoked the puritan laws of the Commonwealth. Theatres have re-opened and by royal decree women are allowed to perform for the very first time.

In the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane, there is an orange seller whose wit and charisma will soon make her one of the countryâ€™s most celebrated actors. She will enchant the crowds, with the heart of the king and dance her way into history. Her name is Nell.

Nell Gwynn is a bawdy, fun, big-hearted love letter to the theatre. Come and experience the exhilarating take on some of the greatest personalities (and biggest wigs) of the Restoration.
