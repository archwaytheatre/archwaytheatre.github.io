England. The swinging 1660s. King Charles II has revoked the puritan laws of the Commonwealth. Theatres have re-opened and by royal decree women are allowed to perform on the stage for the very first time.

In the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane there is an orange seller whose wit and charisma will soon make her one of the countryâ€™s most celebrated actors. She will enchant the crowds, win the heart of the King and dance her way into history. Her name is Nell.

Nell Gwynn is a bawdy, fun, big-hearted love letter to the theatre. Written in 2015 by Jessica Swale for Shakespeare's Globe, it is a fast-paced modern comedy. Come and be a part of this exhilarating take on some of the greatest personalities (and biggest wigs) of the Restoration.

More information about auditions (including audition pack) will be published in due course, but if you would like script details in the meantime then please contact the director Michael Thonger.
