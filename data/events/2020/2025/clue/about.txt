Who? What? When? Where? How!?

Just some of the questions that arise when six seemingly random guests appear at a stately home for an evening of awkward pleasantries, light entertainment and, oh yes, a murder!

Clue has been featured both on stage and screen and will now be brought to the Archway audience who are asked to sleuth their way through the rogues’ gallery.

With multiple possible endings, which one will you see, who did it, and why? How many shots were fired? Can you guess before the big reveal? Perhaps the butler did it after all… you will have to come to find out!
