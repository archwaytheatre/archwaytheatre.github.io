Whats going on? The phones have stopped working. Social media is being anti-social, even TikTok has stopped ticking! What is everyone going to do now, how are they going to fill their time and how are they going to connect with the rest of the world?

A fascinating look at just what our young people can do, how they can rediscover and reaffirm who they are. Taken from the ideas of the Workshoppers, 'Echoes' will make you think, make you laugh and give you a new insight into what our youngsters feel about their world.

We are excited to bring another original production from our wonderful Youth Workshop. Echoes will explore issues facing youngsters at home and at school.

Featuring elements from their workshops including improvisation and scripted scenes, as well as showcasing their dramatic skills, characterisation and energetic enthusiasm!

Going on past years' experiences, it will be fabulous!
