We are excited to bring another original production from our wonderful Youth Workshop. Echoes will explore issues facing youngsters at home and at school.

This piece is particularly exciting as it will evolve with the workshopper’s input.

Featuring elements from their workshops including improvisation and scripted scenes, as well as showcasing their dramatic skills, characterisation and energetic enthusiasm!

Going on past years’ experiences, it will be fabulous, with tickets selling out very quickly.

So check out the dates that tickets go on sale and put it in your diary so that you don’t miss out!
