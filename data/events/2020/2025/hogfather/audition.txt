Pratchett’s back! After the sell-out success of previous Pratchett adaptations, we are delighted to be mounting another of the brilliant Discworld adaptations in the Studio.

Staging will be traverse again, as per ‘Lord and Ladies’ (if you saw that), fast paced and very character based. Below is the ideal size cast, with doubling and playing ages.

If you are interested, please come along. Any questions, contact Gary Andrews
