Jo and Lisa are delighted to be collaborating again and will be bringing 'What you Will' their own spin on Shakespeare's 12th Night to the stage in March/April of next year. Somewhat surprisingly, it will have an 80s rock vibe, pretty much picking up from where Binderella left them.

Will Orsino the lead singer of a rock band, manage to woo the supermodel Olivia, or will his curious new Roadie divert his attention instead!?... This will be a high energy comedy and Lisa and Jo are committed to making it a whole lot of (likely camp, irreverent) fun for the cast, crew and the audience.
