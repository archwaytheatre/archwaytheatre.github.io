Jo and Lisa are delighted to be collaborating again and will be bringing 'What you Will' their own spin on Shakespeare's 12th Night to the stage in March /April of next year. Somewhat surprisingly, it will have an 80s rock vibe, pretty much picking up from where Binderella left them.

Will Orsino the lead singer of a rock band, manage to woo the supermodel Olivia, or will his curious new Roadie divert his attention instead!?... This will be a high energy comedy and Lisa and Jo are committed to making it a whole lot of (likely camp, irreverent) fun for the cast, crew and the audience.

Those with musical ability are particularly welcome to audition. The audition will be 30 December at 7.45, watch this space - more details will be in the next newsletter (and find out more at the meet the directors evening!)

If you want to register early interest or contact Jo / Lisa with any questions do get in touch.
