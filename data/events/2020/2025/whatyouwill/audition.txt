Our tale begins with stranded and separated twins Viola & Sebastian arriving in the superficial, yet fantastical land of Illyria which is governed, for want of a better word, by ’The Lord of Rock’ (Orsino) & bedazzled by the beautiful & much desired supermodel, Olivia. Seeking employment and believing her brother is dead, Viola adopts her male alter ego ‘Cesario’ and sets course to serve The Lord (of Rock) who quickly takes Cesario under his wing and sends ‘him’ on the important errand of wooing Olivia on Orsino's behalf…bad move dude.

Meanwhile, Olivia’s interfering staff concoct mischief with the help of Feste (Olivia’s personal entertainer) to exact revenge on the much-detested Malvolio.
When Sebastian (not dead!) rocks up looking just like Cesario, well…what could possibly go wrong?

This promises to be Shakespeare like you’ve not seen it before, with plenty of music and laughter to persuade even the most doubtful among you that The Bard’s work is not just for those who love Shakespeare, but for those who think ‘God no’…I can’t do that. Yes! You can! We promise!
