The Archway theatre has a “cunning plan” to bring Blackadder II to Horley!
The second series of the sitcom aired on the BBC over 35 years ago. Set in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, it sees the principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder, as a Tudor courtier attempting to win the favour of the Queen whilst being thwarted at every turn by rivals and incompetent friends.

The Archway is presenting three episodes of Blackadder’s attempts to better his position and restore his fortune, only to be de-railed in every case! In ‘Bells’ his marriage plans take an unexpected turn, whilst in ‘Beer’ his chance of an inheritance falls foul of a drinking competition. In ‘Chains’ his heroism is short-lived in a final showdown with an evil Prince.

Join us for a festive fortnight of merriment and start your Christmas with a rousing helping of Blackadder, Baldrick, Queenie, Nursie, Melchit and Percy, not forgetting Lord Flasheart and…..BOB !!
