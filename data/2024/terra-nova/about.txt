A dramatisation of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole in 1911-1912
Drawn from the journals and letters found on Scott’s frozen body.
The action moves backwards and forwards in time between Antarctica and England, it shows not only the extraordinary courage and fortitude of the team battling against the conditions but also the very human emotions and motivations which drove them forward.
The delirium and death of Evans, the self-sacrifice of Oates and the final tragedy of Wilson, Bowers and Scott are recounted in a mixture of fantasy and realism.
This is achieved by the conjured presence of Scott’s wife, Kathleen, and - in a variety of guises - of Amundsen whose party beat Scott to the South Pole.
This play is a powerful story both tragic and uplifting and stays faithful to the historical facts of Scott’s undertaking.
