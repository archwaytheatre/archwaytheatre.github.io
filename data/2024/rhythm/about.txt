The Rhythm of Life will take the audience on a journey through existence, showcasing the universal human experience through various Musical Theatre songs, including hits from the best of Broadway and the West End.

Our talented cast, made up of children and adults will be singing their hearts out as they navigate the audience through the trials and tribulations of life, from childhood, self- discovery and love to heartbreak, self-doubt and loss.

This relatable family show will have you tapping your feet, smiling, and clapping, possibly wiping a tear but most of all, it will leave you feeling nostalgic, happy and uplifted.
