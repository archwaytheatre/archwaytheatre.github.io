by William Shakespeare, directed by Gary Andrews

This year we begin an exciting new collaboration with RBG Kew – Wakehurst: three weekends of open-air theatre (matinees only) in the beautiful gardens there.

For 2024 we will be presenting Shakespeare’s magical comedy A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Always a firm favourite and especially suitable to open air performance, this production will be set in the late Victorian period, when the interest in fairy magic was especially popular, and will lean heavily in style on the works of Arthur Rackham.

So, bring a picnic and wallow in the beauty of nature and the sparkling humour of this classic play.

Garden open 10:00 (entry included with ticket)
Picnic area open 12:30
Show starts 14:30
Bring a picnic and seating.
