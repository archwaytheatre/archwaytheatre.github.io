Playing Dates: 15 & 16, 22 & 23 and 29 & 30 June. 2:30pm at Wakehurst Place Rehearsals Start: 16th April
I'm very excited to be directing this play in the beautiful grounds of Wakehurst Place this summer.
The play will be set in the late Victorian period for the human world - the fairies will be 'tatty Elizabethan'. Below are the characters with gender and age guidance...
At least one of Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth & Mustardseed needs to be a good singer.
