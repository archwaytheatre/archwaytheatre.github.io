by Paul Allen, from the screenplay by Mark Herman, directed by Greg Field

Strikes, cost of living crisis, and community morale at an all-time low…except it’s 1994 not 2024. In the Yorkshire mining town of Grimley, bandleader Danny’s dreams of leading the colliery brass band to victory in the national championships at the Albert Hall seem ‘out of tune’ with reality, as workers choose between picket lines and redundancy packages.

But when Flugelhorn playing Gloria returns to her hometown, heads are turned, spirits are raised, and the band get their ‘oompah’ back. But what’s the real reason for Gloria coming back? And can a community that’s fighting to maintain dignity and hope, survive another set of betrayals?

Brassed Off is the acclaimed stage play of the award-winning film. Don’t miss this story of music and the human spirit’s triumph over hardship and despair.
