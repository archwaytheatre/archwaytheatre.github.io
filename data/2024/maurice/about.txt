This year, for the Youth Workshopâ€™s 30th production, we find ourselves in the little town of Bad Blintz. Maurice, a streetwise cat is coordinating a scam involving some very clever rats. 
Two not so clever Rat Catchers are in the control of the very evil Rat King and nothing is quite what it seems in this battle for supremacy! 
This terrifyingly terrific musical based on the Terry Pratchett story is full of quirky characters and lots of rats! Perfect for our multi- talented Workshoppers.
