Set in 1983, Di and Viv and Rose is an exploration of female friendship.
Three girls meet at university and bond so well that they decide to move in together.
The play follows the ever-changing fortunes of their lives at university and beyond.
Di is a sporty business student, bursting with energy. Viv is an ambitious design student intent on escaping her roots and middle-class Rose is a history of art student, lovable and promiscuous.
It is such a well written play, crackling with wit and poignant observation that few people would fail to enjoy it.
