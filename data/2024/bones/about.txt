This black comedy is set in a run down 1960’s porn cinema in Gateshead. The business is on the verge of bankruptcy where they owe a shed load of money to a local gangster. But their problem seems to be over when one of them kidnaps Reggie Kray…

Sharp, uncompromising and witty, Bones is a deliciously dark comedy about family ties, gangland warfare and a man in a dress.

This play contains very strong language and violence associated with gangland Britain in the 1960’s.
