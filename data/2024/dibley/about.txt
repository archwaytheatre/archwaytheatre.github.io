The Christmas season is one to be enjoyed with family and friends and what better way to enjoy this magical season than in the company of our very own Vicar of Dibley and her fellow villagers.
Enjoy as the village broadcast for the very first time their own radio station “Radio Dibley” and prepare for the penultimate Christmas Nativity play.
The Archway Theatre brings back all the loveable characters of Dibley and can’t wait to kick start your Christmas festivities. Merry Christmas everyone.
