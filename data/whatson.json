    "about": "Colder than Here Written by Laura Wade, Directed by Elodie Bass\n\nMyra may be dying of cancer, but she’s hardly going to let that dampen her spirit. Instead, she decides to face things head on, planning out her own end while trying to fix the relationships between her husband, Alec, and daughters, Harriet and Jenna. As each family member struggles to cope with Myra’s illness, they find themselves drawn closer through moments of emotion, vulnerability, support, and surprising humor. Though a play about cancer, Laura Wade’s Colder Than Here finds opportunities for joy and laughter—a testament to family, relationships and finding light even in the darkest of times.",
