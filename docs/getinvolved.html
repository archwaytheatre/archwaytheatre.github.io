            About the Play:
          </h3>
          <div>
            It’s bonfire Night 2019, Sheila, Denise, Julie and Fay are ‘Team C’ in Pennine Mineral Water Ltd’s annual
       outward-bound team-building weekend. Somehow Sheila has been nominated team leader, where using her cryptic
       crossword solving skills has unwittingly stranded her team on Rampsholme Island on Lake Derwentwater in the
       Lake District. Our intrepid heroines find themselves manufacturing weapons from cable ties and spatulas, and
       create a rescue flag with plastic plates and a toasting fork! Questions are asked, truths are told; dirty washing
       is aired. This hilarious and darkly funny play is an updated ’female version’ of the hugely successful
       ‘Neville’s Island’ where Eddie Directed the Amateur premiere in 1996.

            Dingbats Improv Classes
          </h1>
          <p>
            Learn how to improvise in a friendly and supportive environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our classes are where we have the most fun. You don’t have to be an actor or a comedian to attend – just a genuine human being who can listen and laugh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the level, all the classes consist of silly ice-breaker warm ups, exercises to learn new skills and lots of time to play scenes and practise what we’ve learnt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improv is the perfect skill to develop if you are an actor looking to enhance your skill set, a writer looking for inspiration or anyone looking to unwind after work and gain a better understanding of creative collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            We run improv courses and drop-in workshops which each focus on different types of improvisation and are suitable for different levels of experience. Some take place online, but most are either at The Hawth Theatre in Crawley or here at The Archway Theatre in Horley.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dingbats is also available for hire to run a workshop for your team, whether that be a team within a business or an improv group looking for an experienced coach.
