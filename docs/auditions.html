            </h3>
            <div>
              <pre>Based on comic characters created by Charles Addams in a series of magazine cartoons
and popularised by the 1960s tv series and 1990s movies. In the kooky, upside-down world
of the Addams Family the quirky family still must deal with many of the same challenges
faced by any other family. While the Addams have lived by their unique values for hundreds
of years their macabre, beloved daughter Wednesday is now an eighteen-year-old young woman
and has fallen in love with Lucas Beineke, a boy from a ‘normal’ Ohio family.

The Beinekes are the most un-Addams sounding family you think you might meet!
To make matters worse, Wednesday has invited the Beinekes to the Addams’ home for
one ‘normal’ dinner. During the events that unfold secrets are disclosed, relationships are
tested, and the Addams family must face up to the one horrible thing they’ve managed to
avoid for generations: change.

Can’t wait to see you all – Ali Hannant and Maddie Jowett

                    Gomez Addams - 35-55, male, 
                    <span>
                      A suave man of Spanish descent who adores his wife and children and takes immense pride in being an Addams. Gomez finds himself trapped between his daughter and his wife, being forced to hide Wednesday’s big secret from Morticia. He has great comedic timing and is a strong dancer.

                    Morticia Addams - 35-55, female, 
                    <span>
                      The darkly mysterious matriarch of the Addams family who believes strongly in family tradition. Morticia is unnerved thinking that Gomez is hiding something from her. She is confident and poised with a side of dry wit. Tango skills a plus! Her movements are understated but her look can speak volumes. Suggested songs to focus on:

                    Wednesday Addams - 18-22, female, 
                    <span>
                      Gothic big sister Wednesday who has her father’s heart and her mother’s sensibility falls in love with a “normal” boy whom she brings home to meet the family. Wednesday is trying to balance her relationships with her “strange” family with that of her new love and his “normal” family. Wednesday showcases compassion, a bit of stubbornness and strong will. She has a strong singing voice. Suggested songs to focus on:

                    Pugsley Addams - 12-16, male, 
                    <span>
                      The youngest of the Addams Family, Pugsley loves to be tortured by his big sister. He is lost trying to figure out his place now that she has a new boyfriend and family dynamics are changing. Pugsley is funny, mischievous and teasing. Don’t be put off by solo singing, it’s more important to convey the role! Suggested song to focus on:

                    Uncle Fester - 35-60, male, 
                    <span>
                      Serving as the narrator of the show, Uncle Fester is lovable, childish, enthusiastic and highly incorrigible. Fester has great comedic timing and a tenor voice. Physical humour and playing with the audience is a must ....Ukulele skills a plus! Suggested songs to focus on:

                    <span>
                      Fun, quirky and feisty, Grandma always has a trick up her sleeve. Grandma is wise, wacky and sometimes a bit crass. She has great comedic timing and physicality. Don’t be put off by solo singing, it’s more important to convey the role! Suggested song to focus on:

                    Lurch - 25–60, male, 
                    <span>
                      A man of few words, Lurch is the Addams Family butler. His unmistakable commanding presence is accented by grunts, moans and deliberate movement. Must have great non-verbal story-telling abilities (think: facial expressions and sound). Lurch has a rich bass voice but we may play with the song, so solo singing not necessarily essential – conveying the role is much more important! Suggested song to focus on:

                    <span>
                      The uptight father of Lucas and cold-shouldered husband to Alice, cynical Mal meets the Addams with scepticism. He finds the Addams to be too bizarre for his liking and cannot fathom being related to them. Suggested song to focus on:

                    Alice Beinecke - 35-55, female, 
                    <span>
                      Lucas’s mother and Mal’s wife, Alice is strongly devoted to her family. She presents herself as reserved and collected (even when speaking in rhyme) until she learns to unleash her wild side at dinner with the Addams. She is a strong comedic actress with an ability to really sell a song! We may play ‘Waiting ‘ in a new way – so just show us what you’ve got! Suggested song to focus on:

                      The hopeful romantic and son of Alice & Mal, Lucas has fallen in love with Wednesday and intends to marry her. He is optimistic and hopeful yet struggles to find the balance between his ‘normal’ family and the macabre Addams. Suggested song to focus on:

                      All Vocal Ranges, The Addams’ ancestors from various eras serve as the chorus for the show and help bring the story to life. They will be featured singing, dancing, acting, creating the settings and scenery throughout the entire show (once released from the family crypt!). Seeking actors with vocals, acting and dancing abilities but not necessarily all three! Character performing is key! Suggested Addams Family audition song:
