          </h3>
          <div>
            <pre>Archway’s newest directors AND writers, Jenna & Abi, are bringing us something a
little bit different (but very exciting) to the studio this year! An opportunity to get
involved in some meaningful and powerful theatre, tackling hard subjects and raising
awareness for important issues facing many young people today. We would love to
also welcome new faces and encourage all to audition. If cast, you will be asked to
become a member.

Alive or Living? is a short production composed of two 1-act plays – ‘Schrödinger’s
Boys’ written & directed by Abigail Field, and ‘It Takes Time’ written & directed by
Jenna Simmonds-Wood.

Each piece provides a window into the effects of depression and suicide on both the
person directly affected and the people surrounding them and will therefore contain
themes of such.

Playing dates: 8th, 9th and 10th of August 2024 including Saturday matinee 10th of
August.

"Schrödinger's Boys" written & directed by Abigail Field.
Nathan is a struggling 19-year-old who, after a failed suicide attempt, is trying to
maintain the normal relationships with those around him whilst still dealing with
feelings of loneliness and meaninglessness.

"It Takes Time" written & directed by Jenna Simmonds-Wood.
A family’s life comes to a halt when the youngest child Jess takes her own life. Familial
relationships are more important than ever but communication has become too
hard, and everyone is falling apart.

Bones is a dark comedy, set in a 1960s porn Cinema, where the receptionist ‘accidentally’ kidnaps Reggie Kray. You can’t get much more bizarre than that!

Two Jewish brothers are at war with each other. Their business is on the verge of bankruptcy, and they owe a shed-load of money to a local gangster. But all of their troubles seem to be over when one of them kidnaps Reggie Kray!

Sharp, uncompromising and witty, Bones is a deliciously dark comedy about family ties, gangland warfare and a man in a dress!

The language is very strong, with violence associated with gangland Britain in the 1960s. I saw this performed in Sunderland and have wanted to direct it ever since.</pre>
