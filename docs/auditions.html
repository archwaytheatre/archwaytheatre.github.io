            <pre>Playing dates Tuesday 30th April -Sat 4th May Wednesday 8th May-Sat 11th May this includes the new Saturday matinee.

Constellations is a one act play with just 2 actors.

A quantum physicist and a beekeeper meet at a barbeque. They hit it off, or perhaps they don't. They go home together, or maybe they go their separate ways. In the multiverse, with every possible future ahead of them, a love of honey could make all the difference.

The play hops around on a timeline in the lives of two people showing the infinite possibilities and explores the ups and downs of relationships. The play is both funny and heartbreaking.

When last revived in London this play was staged with 4 different casts. I saw first hand how the same dialogue could be performed so differently based on the couple at the heart of it and it was wonderful to watch, in between seeing the matinee and the evening show with a different cast I had emailed Rep to say I was keen to direct this!

-

I plan to stage this with two casts - (this will mean half the number of performances as we alternate between casts.) The play is written as a male/ female couple but I don't see this as limiting who might eventually perform the roles of scientist and beekeeper.

Age wise the play has a different feel if the couple are in their 20s or their 50s so I go into this audition with a completely open mind.

What I am looking for is chemistry!

I have copies of the script. If you would like to look at one please get in touch. The audition will look at a couple of extracts but will also include a small amount of improvisation so I can explore how different pairings work together.
