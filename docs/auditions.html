Last week, Andrew was that guy with his girl lunching in KFC, discussing apartments and making plans for the future. Today he's in Moscow, in an undisclosed hotel room, on the run and at risk of assassination.

Last week, a nobody. This week, America's Most Wanted: a man who humiliated his country with one touch of a button.

A darkly comic play that explores the unexpected, bewildering, and life-changing consequences of challenging the status quo at a global level.

This play first Premiered at Hampstead Theatre in 2016. Mike Bartlett is an award-winning dramatist and playwright.</pre>

Terra Nova is a fascinating and beautiful play by the Academy Award-winning screenwriter for 'Silence of the Lambs', Ted Tally, that recounts the ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition, led by Capt. Robert Falcon Scott, drawn from the journals and letters found with the bodies of the final three members of the Expedition.

As each dies one by one, the play captures with chilling intensity the courage and bravery of the men who must accept the bitter knowledge that suffering and death will be the only reward for their heroism.

The action of the play blends scenes of the explorer and his men at various stages of their ordeal in a mixture of fantasy and realism via flashbacks of Scott with his wife and with fateful glimpses of his Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen.

For the audition we will be reading from various scenes and moments in the play, both as a group and individually. Age ranges are a guide only, it’s more important to capture the characters’ physical or emotional state to bring the story together. This will be something will be looking for at the audition.

Rehearsals are likely to start W/C 26th August with up to 3 rehearsals a week. Please bring notice of any non-availability including any Sundays to the audition.

For more information on the play, and audition pieces / script please contact the director.</pre>
