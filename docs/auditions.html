            <pre>Playing Dates: Thursday 30th May, Friday 31st May, Sat 1st June 2024

This play is the true account of some of the life of the serial killer John George Haigh who became known as "The Acid Bath Murderer" and is currently an 'exhibit' at Madam Tussauds in London.

We first see Haigh in the condemned cell at Wandsworth Prison 6th August 1949. But then flashback immediately to his home with his strict Plymouth Brethren parents (1930s). His marriage at 25 to Beatrice Hamer. His attempts at various business ventures, some honest, others fraudulent and his descent into crime and eventually murder. John Haigh believed that if someone is murdered but a body is never found then the police cannot charge the suspected perpetrator. The play shows Haigh's association with Barbara Stevens a Crawley woman and her father, Haigh's employer at the Crawley Company of "Hurstlea Products". This play features the murder of 6 people and how Haigh disposed of the bodies by sulphuric acid.

This is not a complete list of characters; these are just the main ones, there will be a total cast of around 35-40 Characters. Numerous small roles with just a few lines e.g. 2-3 receptionists, 3 reporters from newspapers Daily Mirror, a Vicar, a nurse, small crowd scene etc. Therefore, most of the cast will need to play 2-4 roles with some quick costume changes.

We have 30 or so scenes, some are very short, just one or two lines sometimes.

There will be a few GUNSHOTS in the 2nd Act. And an occasional body decomposing in sulphuric Acid. (Just plain water actually).

So, if you're keen, not of a nervous disposition and up for playing up to 5 different parts we'll see you at the audition.

I'm very excited to be directing this play in the beautiful grounds of Wakehurst Place this summer.

The play will be set in the late Victorian period for the human world - the fairies will be 'tatty Elizabethan'. Below are the characters with gender and age guidance...

At least one of Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth & Mustardseed needs to be a good singer.
