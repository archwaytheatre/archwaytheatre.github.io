<!--            The Archway Theatre is a thriving "little theatre" located under the railway arches in Horley, near Gatwick.-->
<!--        </p>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            We pride ourselves on a professional approach, and we are rather ambitious with some of our productions.-->
<!--            We try all aspects of theatre, from musicals through drama to pantomime.-->
<!--            We open to the public, but also as a club our members can buy tickets at a reduced rate,-->
<!--            take advantage of the youth workshop facilities, and visit the member's bar.-->
<!--            Those wishing to go on stage or backstage are members of the company, who put on all the shows.-->
