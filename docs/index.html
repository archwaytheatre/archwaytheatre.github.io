Your ideas are the paint, the stage is the canvas, the performers are the brushes, the bits between the scenes are the pot of water in which you wash your brush... I could continue with this analogy, but it's much easier to be literal sometimes:

A variety of improv comedy groups will use drawings and sculptures that you create on the night to inspire improvised games, scenes, stories and maybe even songs!

Turn up at 19:40 when doors open to craft your art! Whether you've won the Turner prize or you've never picked up a pencil, our performers will treat your creations like masterpieces! Perfect for those who prefer their suggestions to be seen, not heard.

This show will also feature some 'jam', where participants of the Dingbats Improv workshops can sign up to play some fun arty improv games in the show.

So don't just picture it, come along to this unique event and turn your sketches into... sketches.

The (cashless) bar in the function room will be open. Suitable for ages 16+Tickets: £10. Online ticket sales only. Ticket sales close 1 hour before the start.

Judy & Johnny appear to be living the dream, but beneath the gorgeous frocks, vibrant décor and abundance of cocktails, life for the couple isn’t as picturesque as it first seems. Every marriage needs a little fantasy to keep it sparkling, but an unusual life decision raises concerns from their loved ones, and cracks start to form when Johnny invites his new boss over for drinks.

They go their separate ways, or do they go home together. Any and every future outcome is possible in the multiverse.

This is a play about love and the complexities of navigating relationships.   This play explores the infinite trajectories that love can take to bring people together or pull them apart, through fate, chance and choice. Contains adult themes, mature language, discusses terminal illness and assisted suicide.

Elle Foray and Laura Day take on the parts of Rosie the beekeeper and Marianne the quantum physicist are performing Constellations on Tuesday 30th April, Thursday 2nd May, Saturday 4th May at 7.45pm, Wednesday 8th May and Friday 10th May.

They go their separate ways, or do they go home together. Any and every future outcome is possible in the multiverse.

This is a play about love and the complexities of navigating relationships.   This play explores the infinite trajectories that love can take to bring people together or pull them apart, through fate, chance and choice. Contains adult themes, mature language, discusses terminal illness and assisted suicide.

Our Young Adults workshop for 16-21 year olds is welcoming new members and is led by Ella Sowton with Leigh Evans. In the lead up to the Constellations audition several of the Young Adults spent time looking at various extracts of the play and they did a fantastic jon, their youth brings another different take on the play and so the Archway Theatre is excited that two pairs of actors from the Young Adults will also have the opportunity to perform Constellations and we hope that our theatre community will also come together to support their one off performances. Liv Brown and Rachel Harrison will be performing on Monday 6th May and Jenna Simmonds-Wood and Lorna Flanagan will be performing on Tuesday 7th May. Tickets for their performances will be priced at £9

For 2024 we will be presenting Shakespeare’s magical comedy A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Always a firm favourite and especially suitable to open air performance, this production will be set in the late Victorian period, when the interest in fairy magic was especially popular, and will lean heavily in style on the works of Arthur Rackham.

So, bring a picnic and wallow in the beauty of nature and the sparkling humour of this classic play.
