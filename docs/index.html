Our Young Adults workshop for 16-21 year olds is welcoming new members and is led by Ella Sowton with Leigh Evans. In the lead up to the Constellations audition several of the Young Adults spent time looking at various extracts of the play and they did a fantastic jon, their youth brings another different take on the play and so the Archway Theatre is excited that two pairs of actors from the Young Adults will also have the opportunity to perform Constellations and we hope that our theatre community will also come together to support their one off performances. Liv Brown and Rachel Harrison will be performing on Monday 6th May and Jenna Simmonds-Wood and Lorna Flanagan will be performing on Tuesday 7th May. Tickets for their performances will be priced at £9

Three girls meet at university and bond so well that they decide to move in together.

The play follows the ever-changing fortunes of their lives at university and beyond.

Di is a sporty business student, bursting with energy. Viv is an ambitious design student intent on escaping her roots and middle-class Rose is a history of art student, lovable and promiscuous.

It is such a well written play, crackling with wit and poignant observation that few people would fail to enjoy it.</pre>

                <pre>Set in 1983, Di and Viv and Rose is an exploration of female friendship.

Three girls meet at university and bond so well that they decide to move in together.

The play follows the ever-changing fortunes of their lives at university and beyond.

Di is a sporty business student, bursting with energy. Viv is an ambitious design student intent on escaping her roots and middle-class Rose is a history of art student, lovable and promiscuous.

It is such a well written play, crackling with wit and poignant observation that few people would fail to enjoy it.</pre>

For 2024 we will be presenting Shakespeare’s magical comedy A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Always a firm favourite and especially suitable to open air performance, this production will be set in the late Victorian period, when the interest in fairy magic was especially popular, and will lean heavily in style on the works of Arthur Rackham.

So, bring a picnic and wallow in the beauty of nature and the sparkling humour of this classic play.
